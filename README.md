### Apart from being a DevOps | Automation Engineer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors.🌱 

:snowflake: In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. 
:sunny: During the warmer months here in Armenia, I enjoy swimming, gym, dancing, and mountain biking.

👯 When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef :stew:, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the software development world 🌍.
