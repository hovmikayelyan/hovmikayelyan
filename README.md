### As Rick once said...I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it.

:computer: First and foremost, I love writing code.
🔭 What do I do?<br/>

✔️I've been developing since the 2018 year using various languages and best development practices.

Apart from being an IT Engineer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors.🌱 

:snowflake: In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. 
:sunny: During the warmer months here in Armenia, I enjoy swimming, gym, dancing, and mountain biking.

👯 When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef :stew:, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the software development world 🌍.
